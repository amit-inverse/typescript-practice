## What does the term "decorator" mean in TypeScript?
In TypeScript, a `decorator` is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter. Decorators use the form `@expression`, where expression must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.

Decorators are part of the TypeScript language and are inspired by the decorator pattern from object-oriented design. They provide a way to modify or extend the behavior of classes, methods, or properties during runtime. Decorators are commonly used in frameworks like Angular to define and configure aspects of components, services, and other application elements.

Here's a simple example of using a decorator in TypeScript:
```
function logClass(target: Function) {
  // target is the constructor function of the class
  console.log(`Class ${target.name} is decorated.`);
}

@logClass
class MyClass {
  // class implementation
}
```
In this example, the `logClass` decorator is applied to the `MyClass` class. When the script runs, the decorator function is invoked with the constructor function of `MyClass` as its argument, allowing us to perform actions or modifications at runtime.

It's important to note that decorators are an experimental feature in ECMAScript and TypeScript, and their syntax and behavior might evolve over time.

## Is it possible to apply multiple decorators to a single function, and if so, how can it be done?
Yes, it is possible to apply multiple decorators to a single function in TypeScript. We can simply list the decorators one after another on the same line, and they will be applied in the order they are listed. Here's an example:
```
function firstDecorator(target: any, key: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    console.log('First decorator applied');
}

function secondDecorator(target: any, key: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    console.log('Second decorator applied');
}

class ExampleClass {
    @firstDecorator
    @secondDecorator
    exampleMethod() {
        console.log('Method implementation');
    }
}

const instance = new ExampleClass();
instance.exampleMethod();
```
In this example, the `exampleMethod` of the `ExampleClass` has both `@firstDecorator` and `@secondDecorator` applied. When you create an instance of `ExampleClass` and call `exampleMethod`, you will see the console output:
```
First decorator applied
Second decorator applied
Method implementation
```
The order of decorator application is from bottom to top, meaning the decorator listed at the bottom is applied first, followed by the one above it. This allows for a flexible and composable way of combining different behaviors or metadata for a single function.
